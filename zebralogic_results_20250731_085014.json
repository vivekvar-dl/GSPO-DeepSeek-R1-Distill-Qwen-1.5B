So, let's note down the red house. Also, from clue 12, the man who smokes Blends drinks beer. So, if we can find out where the Blends smoker lives, he drinks beer, which could help us connect other clues.\n\nFrom clue 9: The man who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. So once we know where Blends smokes, his neighbors must include someone who owns a cat. But maybe that's not directly useful yet.\n\nAnother point: Clue 8 says the center house (House 3) drinks milk. So, position 3 is milk. That might be connected with other clues like green vs. white or other things.\n\nClue 4 says the green house is on the left of the white house. So, green comes before white. Which means green cannot be the last"

Since there are three friends and three attributes per friend, it seems correct.\n\nWait no, actually, in the problem statement, I think each friend has both an attribute? Wait, let me re-read.\n\nWait no, perhaps each friend has only one attribute, but since they can't have multiple things at once, maybe one of the two. But I'm getting confused now. Let me try again.\n\nWait, in the initial setup, I thought each friend could have either their favorite color or their pet. So each friend has exactly one attribute, which is either their favorite color or their pet. That makes sense because each friend can't have both.\n\nSo for example, if someone likes red, then their pet must be something else; same vice versa. But wait, that might complicate things, so perhaps we should separate the two as two separate attributes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each friend has both attributes, but that would make more than six possibilities, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps better to model this as two separate tables. One for"

Also, since she studies Math, she must be in one of the other subjects (but wait, she could also be in one of the dorms). Wait, no\u2014the subject and dorm are separate, right? Each person has both a subject and a dorm. So, if Dana studies Math, then her subject is fixed as Math, but where does she live?\n\nFrom clue 5: The student studying Art lives in South dorm. So someone else (not necessarily Dana) is in Art and South.\n\nWait, but from clue 6: Dana studies Math. So perhaps, let me note down what we know:\n\n- Dana: Math, but location unknown yet.\n\nAlso, clue 5 says Art student is in South. So another subject\u2014let's see\u2014if Art is in South, who is there? It could be someone else besides Dana.\n\nBut from clue 6, Dana is Math. So not everyone is in their own subject"

That means if David is in position i, Susan must be in i+1.\n\nSo David's possible positions are limited because both he and Susan need to fit without overlapping.\n\nSimilarly, clue 2: Mary is somewhere to the left of Peter, so Mary < Peter.\n\nClue 4: Peter is not next to John. So Peter cannot be adjacent to John.\n\nGiven that, maybe we can start with Mary being in position 1 as per question.\n\nIf Mary is in position 1, then Peter must be in positions 2-4 (since he has to be to"

So, if B has apples, then C must have oranges. However, the converse might not be true\u2014meaning that even if C doesn't have oranges, B might still have apples.\n\nBut wait, there's more information in the clues. Let's see other clues first.\n\nClue 3: Box C does not contain apples.\n\nAh, so regardless of what's in B or D, Box C cannot have apples. That means Box C can only have items other than apples.\n\nClue 4: Either Box A or Box B contains apples (but not both). So exactly one of A or B has apples; neither has apples nor both.\n\nClue 5: If Box A contains apples, then Box B is empty.\n\nSo, if A has apples, then B must"
