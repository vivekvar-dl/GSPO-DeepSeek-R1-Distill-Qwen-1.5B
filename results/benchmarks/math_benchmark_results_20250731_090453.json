But in our case here, since |a|+|b|=100, which can't happen unless both |a| and |b| are positive numbers adding up to 100. Therefore, neither a nor b can be zero; they're both at least 1 in absolute value. That's an important point I missed earlier.\n\nSo Step 2: Let\u2019s consider only cases where a \u2260 0 and b \u2260 0.\n\nTherefore, each pair (a,b) consists of two non-zero integers whose sum of absolute values equals 100.\n\nNow, let's think about how many possible ordered pairs there could be without considering the GCD condition.\n\nSince |a| + |b| = 100, with a and b ranging from -99 to 99 except when their magnitudes add exactly to 100\u2014but actually, more precisely, for any k from 1 to 99, you can choose signs for a and b so that |a| + |b| =k, but perhaps my initial thought process isn\u2019t correct\u2014it might require another approach.\n\nWait, maybe instead of thinking directly in terms of magnitude sums, better to model variables x and y where x=a and y=b, but allowing them to take on negative values too.\n\nBut given that order matters due to \"ordered pairs,\" whether sign changes count differently?\n\nYes, absolutely\u2014they do, because (-5,3) is different than (5,-3), etc.\n\nThus, first, total number of ordered pairs (x,y) satisfying |x| + |y| = 100 is something like...

Let's recall that any point on the circumference of a circle satisfies the equation \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) are the coordinates of the center, and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nSo, given our circle has center at (3,7).

So, normally, the formula for multiset permutation would be 4! divided by (number of repeats factorial), so 4! / 2!.\n\nCalculating that gives 24 / 2 = 12 possible unique arrangements.\n\nBut wait a minute, am I considering cases with different numbers of repeated elements correctly here?

Since our alphabet includes duplicate letters, these could overlap.\n\nIn general, for each pair of identical letters, say 'M', which appears twice, treating them as a single entity reduces the problem size from n=4 to m=3 entities. Then, the number of arrangements becomes 3!, multiplied by the internal arrangement within the block\u2014since both Ms must stay together, there's only 1 way to arrange them internally.\n\nSimilarly, for other pairs like H and T\u2014they don't form blocks, so they remain separate.\n\nTherefore, first calculate the number of \"bad\" arrangements due to having two Ms next to each other.
